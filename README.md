Real Estate Market Analysis in Bucharest


<h1><b> Description </b></h1>
This project uses web scraping techniques to extract real estate listings from a popular Romanian website, and then uses the data to create <b> visualizations </b> and analyze <b> trends </b> in the Bucharest real estate market.

<h2><b> Dependencies </b></h2>
The project is built using Python 3 and the following libraries:

Beautiful Soup (for web scraping)
Altair (for data visualization)

<h2><b> Note </b></h2>
The website from which the data is being extracted may change the HTML structure at any point, causing the script to break. If that happens, the script will need to be updated accordingly.

Also this project is just for academic purpose and data should not be used for commercial purpose.
